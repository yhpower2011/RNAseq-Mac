# This script creates RNA-seq project directories with standard sub-folders.
#
# Usage: 
#   You can run this script directly or embed it in an Automator app.
#   Optionally, provide a base directory as an argument; otherwise, the default is $HOME/Desktop.
#
# The script creates three project folders: RNAseq-a, RNAseq-b, RNAseq-c.
# Inside each project folder, it creates the following subfolders:
# raw_data, trimmed_data, fastqc_results, alignment, counts, and analysis.

# Set the base directory (first argument if provided, or default to Desktop)
BASE_DIR="${1:-$HOME/Desktop}"

# Define project folder names
projects=( "RNAseq-a" "RNAseq-b" "RNAseq-c" )

# Define standard subdirectories for each project
subdirs=( "raw_data" "trimmed_data" "fastqc_results" "alignment" "counts" "analysis" )

# Create folders for each project and its subdirectories
for proj in "${projects[@]}"; do
    proj_dir="$BASE_DIR/$proj"
    mkdir -p "$proj_dir"
    for sub in "${subdirs[@]}"; do
        mkdir -p "$proj_dir/$sub"
    done
    echo "Created folder structure for $proj at $proj_dir"
